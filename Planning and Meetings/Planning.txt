Here the main projects:

	1.Complete the main HTML pages for the web 
	2.Integrate the completed HTML with the current project		
	3.Create animated prototypes main pages for the web  (happy and alternative scenarios)
	4.Develop the service (Web API) layer as the 1.0.0-alpha doesn’t use that layer because it’s not completed
	5.Develop another MVC that use the service layer (last MVC but not DNX it's another project)
	6.Document the requirements of the project, it includes all the requirements (the full not only the main) as:
	7.Create videos as step-by-step for the final approval results

		How to develop the basic part (1.0.0-alpha)
		How to transform the PSD into HTML
		How to integrate the HTML with the basic version
		How to crate the service layer (Web ApI)
		How to create the animated prototype for each platform
		How to develop each platform this include
			Installing and configuring the OS (different OS / platform, e.g. Ubuntu/PHP, Linux-Mint/Java, etc.)
			Installing and configuring the IDE (NetBeans, Eclipse, Xamarin, etc.)
			Download the code from GitHub and step-by-step until finish the modification

	Configure automated build on VSO and try to do that for both (VSO and GitHub)
	Configure a local automated build on Azure (XAML and New Agent)
	Configure a VM as host machine on Azure and manually deploy the last release
	Configure Microsoft Azure Web Sites to host the last release
		Configure a continues delivery to deploy the latest check-in to the servers (Azure website and VM)
		Develop integration test for the service layer
